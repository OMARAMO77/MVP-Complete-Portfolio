2. API Integration with External Services: Challenges in this area have led to delays in the integration process.

### Challenges:

**Most Difficult Technical Challenge:**

The most challenging technical aspect this week involved addressing scalability concerns related to the database. As the project aims for a user-friendly car rental platform, the potential for a growing user base highlights the need for a scalable database solution. The discovery that scalability might become an issue prompted a careful examination of the database architecture. Implementing measures for regular performance monitoring and considering the migration to a more scalable database solution became crucial. This challenge required a balance between addressing immediate database concerns and ensuring a long-term scalable solution. Collaborative discussions with peers and mentors provided valuable insights, aiding in the formulation of a mitigation plan that involves continuous monitoring and a flexible database structure to accommodate future growth.

**Most Difficult Non-Technical Challenge:**

The most challenging non-technical aspect this week was managing time and resources effectively. Balancing frontend and backend development alongside API integration and database setup within the defined two-week window presented a significant challenge. Prioritizing tasks without compromising the overall system quality required meticulous planning and constant reassessment. As a solo developer handling both project lead and full-stack development roles, time management became crucial. The adaptation involved reassessing task priorities, moving certain non-essential features to subsequent development phases, and ensuring that core functionalities received robust implementation. The challenge was not only about meeting development goals but also about delivering a system that aligns with the initial vision while addressing unforeseen challenges. Regular self-assessment and a strict project management approach were adopted to ensure efficient time allocation and adherence to the project timeline.
